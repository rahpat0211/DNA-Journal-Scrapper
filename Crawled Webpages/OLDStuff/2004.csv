"1","10.1093/dnares/11.1.1","The Complete Mitochondrial Genome Sequence of the Haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi and its Relation to Heterokonts","M. Virginia Sánchez Puerta,Tsvetan R. Bachvaroff,Charles F. Delwiche","NO","NO","NO","01 February 2004","Emiliania huxleyi, mitochondria, Haptophyta, genome sequencing, chromoalveolates"," The complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome of Emiliania huxleyi (Haptophyta) was determined. E. huxleyi is the most abundant coccolithophorid, key in many marine ecosystems, and plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle. The mitochondrial genome contains genes encoding three subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, apocytochrome b , seven subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase complex, two ATPase subunits, two ribosomal RNAs, 25 tRNAs and five ribosomal proteins. One potentially functional open reading frame was identified, with no counterpart in any other organism so far studied. The cox1 gene transcript is apparently spliced from two distant segments in the genome. One of the most interesting features in this mtDNA is the presence of the dam gene, which codes for a DNA adenine methyltransferase. This enzyme is common in bacterial genomes, but is not present in any studied mitochondrial genome. Despite the great age of this group (ca. 300 Ma), little is known about the evolution of haptophytes or their relationship to other eukaryotes. This is the first published haptophyte organellar genome, and will improve the understanding of their biology and evolution and allow us to test the monophyly of the chromoalveolate clade.

We analyzed the expression specificity of 8809 genes in 7 organs of Arabidopsis using a cDNA macroarray system. Using relative expression (RE) values between organs, many known and unknown genes specifically expressed in each organ were identified. We also analyzed the organ specificity of various gene groups using the GRE (group relative expression) value, the average of the REs of all genes in a group. Consequently, we found that many gene groups even ribosomal protein genes, have strong organ-specific expression. Clustering of the expression profiles revealed that the 8809 genes were classified into 9 major categories. Although 3451 genes were clustered into the largest category, which showed constitutive gene expression, 266 and 1005 genes were found to be root-and silique-specific genes, respectively. By this clustering, particular gene groups which showed multi-organ-specific expression profiles, such as bud-flower-specific, stem-silique-specific or bud-flower-root-specific profiles, could be effectively identified. From these results, major features of plant organs could be characterized by their distinct profiles of global gene expression. These data of organ-specific gene expression are available at our web site: Arabidopsis thaliana Tissue-Specific Expression Database, ATTED ( Author Webpage ).

By using the newly developed RAMEN assembler, the sequence data derived from whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing were assembled into 49,345 scaffolds that span a total length of 514 Mb including gaps and 387 Mb without gaps. Because the genome size of the silkworm is estimated to be 530 Mb, almost 97% of the genome has been organized in scaffolds, of which 75% has been sequenced. By carrying out a BLAST search for 50 characteristic Bombyx genes and 11,202 non-redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in a Bombyx EST database against the WGS sequence data, we evaluated the validity of the sequence for elucidating the majority of silkworm genes. Analysis of the WGS data revealed that the silkworm genome contains many repetitive sequences with an average length of <500 bp. These repetitive sequences appear to have been derived from truncated transposons, which are interspersed at 2.5- to 3-kb intervals throughout the genome. This pattern suggests that silkworm may have an active mechanism that promotes removal of transposons from the genome. We also found evidence for insertions of mitochondrial DNA fragments at 9 sites. A search for Bombyx orthologs to Drosophila genes controlling sex determination in the WGS data revealed 11 Bombyx genes and suggested that the sex-determining systems differ profoundly between the two species.

The EST H80201 was shown to be expressed only from the paternal allele in normal human lymphoblasts by utilizing a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Monoallelic expression of EST H80201 was also detected in non-tumor adult human brain tissues of gliomas. These ESTs were located directly adjacent to PEG3 in a head-to-head orientation. We have named this new transcript, imprinted transcript 1, which is located upstream but oppositely oriented to PEG3 ( ITUP1 ). The ITUP1 showed a similar expression profile with PEG3 in glioma cell lines. Bisul te genomic sequencing and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis indicated that hypermethylation of the promoter region correlated with the absence of these transcripts. This suggests that ITUP1 and PEG3 are coordinately regulated, and that downregulation of the both genes may be important in the development of glioma.

Here, we revised differences in the sequences of Mu50 and N315, referencing that of Mu3 which were assumed to be of one lineage. The 362 ORFs diverse between Mu50 and N315 were picked up, and the corresponding ones in three strains were re-sequenced.

The fixed diversities of 174 ORFs (except for 39 silent ORFs from 213), including nucleotide substitution (NSs), frame shift, and truncation were grouped into three major functional categories, which were transport (14.9% in the 174 diverse ORFs), metabolism of carbohydrates (5.7%), and RNA synthesis (9.6%). The other gene categories had small diversities. These gene categories seemed to be functionally decisive for the Mu50-specific characters, the thickened cell wall and moderate vancomycin resistance.

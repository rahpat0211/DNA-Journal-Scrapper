Therefore, we concluded that strain VSR751 must be defective in protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO), the product of the hemG gene. By complementation analysis using VSR751, we isolated and identified this gene. The hemG gene is located at 86 mim on the E. coli chromosome, just upstream of the rrnA operon, and is transcribed clockwise in the same direction as the rrnA operon. This gene encodes a 181-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of about 21 kDa. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of flavodoxin motif, suggesting that a cofactor of this enzyme is flavin mononucleotide, which is consistent with the previous report that the mammalian PPO had the flavin cofactor.

The enzyme cleaves two nucleotides 3' from the base of the loop or the TT mismatch. ii) Similar to its reactions with mismatches cleavage of heteroduplex loops by endonucleave VII can also initiate correction of perfect double-strandedness by T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA-ligase in vitro . Loops of 8 nt and 20 nt were repaired efficiently. iii) For the first time endonuclease VII cleavage sites were also mapped in single-stranded DNA if it was part of the 20-nt loop.

We isolated c -kit genomic DNA from ~20 kb upstream to ~10 kb downstream of the transcribed region. We identified two control regions for c -kit gene transcription by fusing genomic sequences to bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter genes and introducing the resultant constructs into differentiated F9 cells. The fragments, Sac I- Apa I in the 9th intron and Xho I- Kpn I in the 13th intron induced reporter gene activities. Nucleotide sequencing of the regions showed in that there were no consensus sequences of the RA receptor or cyclic AMP-responsive elements. Cyclic AMP augmented the expression of the c -kit gene induced by RA; when combined with RA, it was less effective on the reporter gene activity.

These findings suggested that transcription of the c -kit gene is regulated by complex controls and that there are different control regions responsive to RA and cyclic AMP. "," The c -kit gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that reveals the pleiotropic effects both in the developing embryo and in the adult animal. In this study, we characterized transcriptional control of the c -kit gene. F9 teratocarcinoma cells differentiated and expressed the c -kit gene upon exposure to retinoic acid (RA). We isolated c -kit genomic DNA from ~20 kb upstream to ~10 kb downstream of the transcribed region. We identified two control regions for c -kit gene transcription by fusing genomic sequences to bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter genes and introducing the resultant constructs into differentiated F9 cells. The fragments, Sac I- Apa I in the 9th intron and Xho I- Kpn I in the 13th intron induced reporter gene activities. Nucleotide sequencing of the regions showed in that there were no consensus sequences of the RA receptor or cyclic AMP-responsive elements. Cyclic AMP augmented the expression of the c -kit gene induced by RA; when combined with RA, it was less effective on the reporter gene activity. In contrast to other reports, continuous exposure to the reagents was not required for c -kit expression. These findings suggested that transcription of the c -kit gene is regulated by complex controls and that there are different control regions responsive to RA and cyclic AMP. "

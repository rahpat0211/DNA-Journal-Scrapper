Complete nucleotide sequences of both plasmids have been determined, and the putative functions of the encoded proteins and the cis -acting DNA sequences have been analyzed. pO157 shares strikingly similar genes and DNA sequences with F-factor and the transmissible drug-resistant plasmid R100 for DNA replication, copy number control, plasmid segregation, conjugative functions and stable maintenance in the host, although it is defective in DNA transfer by conjugation due to the truncation and deletion of the required genes and DNA sequences. In addition, it encodes several proteins implicated in EHEC pathogenicity such as an EHEC hemolysin (HlyA), a catalase-peroxidase (KatP), a serine protease (EspP) and type II secretion system. pOSAK1 possesses a ColE1-like replication system, and the DNA sequence is extremely similar to that of a drug-resistant plasmid, NTP16, derived from Salmonella typhimurium except that it lacks drug resistance transposons.

The formation of multimers has been observed in a derivative of pKYM which lost a part of the origin region, and the loss of the monomerization mechanism would have led to these multimers. By analyzing the constructs of several mutants, we discovered that a DNA region required for monomerization was present upstream of the RepK binding site in the replication origin. As either of the T-rich sequence or the inverted repeat sequences which were seen in that region have been lost in the multimer-forming plasmids, these sequences may be necessary for monomerization.

The map comprises a series of contigs mostly P1/PAC clones, which span the loci of potential tumor suppressor genes and the Werner's syndrome gene. Each P1/PAC DNA was defined by its size, restriction sites, terminal sequences, intermarker distances and location relative to major genes and markers. The genes on these P1/PAC DNAs were analyzed by an exon amplification method to determine their locations. The genes newly found by the exon amplification method together with other known genes, including those of glutathion reductase, a general transcription factor, protein phosphatase 2A ß subunit and Werner's syndrome, were precisely mapped within the contigs.

DNA sequencing in the region disclosed the presence of AF-6 , a gene that had been identified as the ALL-1 fusion partner involved in acute myeloid leukemias with t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocations. In the work reported here, we determined the complete genomic sequence of the AF-6 gene, including exon-intron boundaries, and found six DNA polymorphisms. One of them, an insertion/deletion polymorphism, determined the presence or absence of seven amino acids in the AF-6 product. We also identified two alternatively spliced forms of the gene; the two novel transcripts would encode additional C-terminal peptides in comparison to the reported protein.

"," In our previous work, detailed deletion mapping of ovarian cancers indicated that a 300-kb region of chromosome 6q27 was likely to contain one or more putative tumor suppressor genes associated with development of this type of cancer. DNA sequencing in the region disclosed the presence of AF-6 , a gene that had been identified as the ALL-1 fusion partner involved in acute myeloid leukemias with t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocations. In the work reported here, we determined the complete genomic sequence of the AF-6 gene, including exon-intron boundaries, and found six DNA polymorphisms. One of them, an insertion/deletion polymorphism, determined the presence or absence of seven amino acids in the AF-6 product.

For this, we isolated cosmid clones corresponding to each gene and placed nine of them on a metric physical map of chromosome 19. Although most genes are scattered over the chromosome, we found three genes are clustered in a 0.6-Mb region at 19q13.3 and two of them, RPL13A and RPS11 , within a single cosmid only 4.3 kb apart. To explore a possible relationship between rp gene defects and human disease, we compared map positions of the rpgenes and disease loci on chromosome 19, which led us to find RPS9 gene in the same interval as the gene for retinitis pigmentosa 11. The disease locus has previously been mapped to the 6-cM interval at 19q13.4 between markers D19S572 and D19S926, which corresponds to less than 2-Mb region on the metric physical map. We mapped RPS9 about 800 kb distal to D19S572. "

ATMKK3 shows high homology (85% identity) to NPK2, a tobacco MAPKK homologue. ATMKK4 and 5 are closely related to each other (84% identity). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the plant MAPKKs constitute at least three subgroups. The recombinant ATMKK3 and ATMKK4 were expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in Escherichia coli . Affinity purified GST-ATMKK3 and GST-ATMKK4 proteins contained phosphorylation activity, which shows that both the ATMKK3 and ATMKK4 genes encode functional protein kinases. Northern blot analysis revealed that the ATMKK3 gene expressed in all the organs. The levels of ATMKK4 and 5 mRNAs were relatively higher in stems and leaves than in flowers and roots. We determined the map positions of the ATMKK3, 4 and 5 genes on Arabidopsis chromosomes by RFLP mapping using P1 genomic clones.

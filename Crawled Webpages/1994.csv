Open reading frames (ORF) in this region were unambiguously identified from the determined sequence, using criteria characteristic for the B. subtilis gene structure, i.e., starting with an ATG, GTG or TTG codon preceded by sequences complementary to the 3' end of the 16S rRNA. Four rRNA gene sets, 7 individual tRNA genes and 1 scRNA gene were identified, occupying 20 kb in total. In the remaining 160 kb region, 158 ORFs were identified, suggesting that 1 ORF is coded on average by 1 kb of DNA of the B. subtilis genome. Among the 158 ORFs, the functions of 48 ORFs were assigned and those of 11 ORFs are suggested through significant similarities to known proteins present in data banks. However, the functions of more than half of the ORFs (63%) remain to be determined.

A cDNA library constructed from microsporocytes in meiotic prophase of Lilium longiflorum was screened with a subtraction probe specific to meiotic prophase. Clones selected were classified into 18 groups by cross hybridization and partial sequencing. Northern blot analysis revealed that the transcripts corresponding to the respective cDNA groups began accumulating at the early stages of meiosis and exhibited clone-specific profiles during meiosis and the spore formation process. The amino acid sequences of the predicted gene products showed similarity with known gene products, e.g. heat shock proteins, serine proteases in Bacillus , and RAD 51 gene product in yeast.

The deduced MSG, referred to as the MSG5 subtype, is a 120,765-Da protein composed of 1,076 amino acids and contains an anchoring hydrophobic sequence at the C-terminus of the protein. Sequence analyses of cloned MSG-cDNAs revealed an MSG-gene family with ~70% protein sequence identity between subtypes.

These recombinant MSG proteins reacted with the antiserum from P. carinii -infected rats, as expected, and antiserum generated against P. carinii -infected mice, indicating the existence of common determinants in MSG polypeptides. The family of MSG proteins is rich in cysteine residues and these cysteine are highly conserved in all MSG subtypes regardless of species specificity, suggesting the structural and/or functional importance of these cysteine.

The internal sequences resemble the 10–11 bp consensus for the scaffold attachment regions found in yeast and drosophila. The characteristic 45-bp sequence was abundant on the ends of chromosomes. The shortest distance between the repeats containing telomeric stem and the telomere was less than 20 kb.

Temperature for electrophoresis and glycerol concentrations in gel affected SSCP patterns significantly. The optimal detection conditions for SSCP also depends on the nucleotide sequences of fragments analyzed. Fragments over 300 bp show complicated patterns depending on their nucleotide sequences and were not suitable for SSCP analysis. Seventy primer pairs were designed from the sequence data available to amplify DNA regions as sequence tagged sites (STSs), and 39 of these STSs were found to generate SSCP between japonica rice (Nipponbare) and indica rice (Kasalath) in at least one of the experimental conditions. The maps of DNA fragments amplified from 186 F 2 -plant DNAs with 17 primer pairs were successfully determined. This direct mapping method of the amplified DNA fragments with PCR is simple and quite sensitive, and can be used to set markers in the gap regions of a genetic linkage map.

These three have been identified as genes for pulmonary surfactant apoprotein (PSP-A), Clara cells 10-kDa secretory protein, and HLA-E heavy chain. In the remaining 745 clones, 221 were composed of89 species that occurred recurrently, and 524 clones appeared only once. Because the 3'-directed cDNA library faithfully represents the mRNA population in the source tissue, these numbers represent the relative activities ofthe gene expression. Altogether 437 gene species were novel, and 179 gene species were identified in GenBank. A significant portion ofthese genes encode proteins found in secretory proteins, cell surface proteins, and components in the protein synthesis machinery, representing the function of the lung.","An expression profile ofgenes active in the human lung was obtained by collecting 797 partial sequences from a 3'-directed cDNA library.

The principle is based on the previous finding that this system can translocate any linear double-stranded DNA up to 40 kb into the phage capsid in a time-dependent manner and the encapsulated DNA becomes DNase-resistant. For this purpose, we constructed a cosmid vector that carries two different antibiotic selection markers at both sides of the multiple cloning site, and after insertion of a DNA segment, the clone was linearized by <U+03BB>-terminase at the cos site. After the packaging reaction in vitro followed by DNase treatment, the encapsulated DNA was introduced into Escherichia coli cells to give clones with unidirectional deletions by differential antibiotic selection. Restriction and sequence analyses of deletion clones demonstrated that an ordered set of clones with nested deletions, ranging from less than 1 kb to 25 kb, was created from either the end of the DNA segment. Thus, nested deletion clones that cover the entire region of a ~40-kb cosmid insert can be obtained by a single packaging reaction, and its restriction map can be simultaneously obtained.

One way is to use a highly-sensitive fluorescent DNA sequencer, where only trace amounts of template DNA and reagents are needed. An experimental protocol optimized for the trace amounts of DNA analysis was established by using the hybridization reaction rate coefficient of primers on template DNA, which was estimated to be 7.5×10 5 M -1 sec -1 at 37°C. One femtomole of template DNA with 0.001 unit of modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase Ver. 2.0) and also 0.45 fmol of M13 template DNA with 0.01 unit of Taq DNA polymerase were enough to sequence DNA of up to 400 bases.

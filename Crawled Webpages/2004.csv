"1","10.1093/dnares/11.1.1","The Complete Mitochondrial Genome Sequence of the Haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi and its Relation to Heterokonts","M. Virginia Sánchez Puerta,Tsvetan R. Bachvaroff,Charles F. Delwiche","NO","NO","NO","01 February 2004","Emiliania huxleyi, mitochondria, Haptophyta, genome sequencing, chromoalveolates"," The complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome of Emiliania huxleyi (Haptophyta) was determined. E. huxleyi is the most abundant coccolithophorid, key in many marine ecosystems, and plays a vital role in the global carbon cycle. The mitochondrial genome contains genes encoding three subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, apocytochrome b , seven subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase complex, two ATPase subunits, two ribosomal RNAs, 25 tRNAs and five ribosomal proteins. One potentially functional open reading frame was identified, with no counterpart in any other organism so far studied. The cox1 gene transcript is apparently spliced from two distant segments in the genome. One of the most interesting features in this mtDNA is the presence of the dam gene, which codes for a DNA adenine methyltransferase. This enzyme is common in bacterial genomes, but is not present in any studied mitochondrial genome. Despite the great age of this group (ca. 300 Ma), little is known about the evolution of haptophytes or their relationship to other eukaryotes. This is the first published haptophyte organellar genome, and will improve the understanding of their biology and evolution and allow us to test the monophyly of the chromoalveolate clade.

We analyzed the expression specificity of 8809 genes in 7 organs of Arabidopsis using a cDNA macroarray system. Using relative expression (RE) values between organs, many known and unknown genes specifically expressed in each organ were identified. We also analyzed the organ specificity of various gene groups using the GRE (group relative expression) value, the average of the REs of all genes in a group. Consequently, we found that many gene groups even ribosomal protein genes, have strong organ-specific expression. Clustering of the expression profiles revealed that the 8809 genes were classified into 9 major categories. Although 3451 genes were clustered into the largest category, which showed constitutive gene expression, 266 and 1005 genes were found to be root-and silique-specific genes, respectively. By this clustering, particular gene groups which showed multi-organ-specific expression profiles, such as bud-flower-specific, stem-silique-specific or bud-flower-root-specific profiles, could be effectively identified. From these results, major features of plant organs could be characterized by their distinct profiles of global gene expression.

It was found that the mitochondrial genome had novel gene arrangements in which genes from NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 to proline tRNA were extensively shuffled with duplicate control regions. These control regions had 99% sequence similarity over 700 bp. Although snake mitochondrial genomes are also known to possess duplicate control regions with nearly identical sequences, the location of the second control region suggested independent occurrence of the duplication on lineages leading to snakes and the Komodo dragon.

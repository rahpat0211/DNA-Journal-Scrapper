In a previous study, 72 actual protein coding regions and their translation initiation sites on the genome of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 were determined by Sazuka et al. using protein two-dimensional electrophoresis and microsequening. In this work, we extracted the sequence patterns surrounding translation initiation sites as HMM using the computer program YEBIS. The constructed HMM could recognize all but one translation initiation site. The HMM contains an AG-rich region (5.7 bp on average), as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence exclusively contains purines, upstream of the translation initiation site (-9.7 position on average) and a CT-rich region (4.2 bp on average) just upstreamfrom the translation initiation site. In addition, we found that the second amino acid (+4,5,6) could be classified into two types, one of which had C as their second codon while another of which has a nucleotide distribution relatively similar to the distribution among amino acids in the 72 proteins. This fact corresponds well to our earlier finding that when the second nucleotide of the second amino acid of a translated protein was C, an initial methionine was processed and that otherwise the methionine was intact with high frequency.

Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli are so distant that there exists veryfew conserved landmarks in their genome organisation. Analysis of the conserved cmk rpsA cluster pinpointed the importance of cytosine nucleotide metabolism. In these bacteria, mRNA turnover provides an efficient means to fulfil the need for CDP as a precursor of DNA synthesis. The cmk rpsA operon is responsible for CDP synthesis. This function is self-explained in the case of the cmk gene (which codes for cytidylate kinase). The case of rpsA , that codes for ribosomal protein S1, is more subtle. It is suggested here that S1 is a RNA-binding protein helping polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase, known to be phylogenetically related to S1) to degrade mRNA, or helper molecule involved in other RNase activities. This provides an explanation for the elusive function of PNPase, which generates nucleoside diphosphates (not monophosphates) when degrading RNA. This also accounts for the discoverythat the B. subtilis comR gene product is PNPase. This article brieflydiscusses the availabilityof cytosine nucleotides in eukaryotes, and suggests that they are derived from phospholipids turnover.

We analyzed its sequence features and found that this region contained at least 894 potential open reading frames (ORFs), of which 346 (38.7%) were previously reported, 158 (17.7%) were homologous to other known genes, 232 (26.0%) were identical or similar to hypothetical genes registered in databases, and the remaining 158 (17.7%) showed no significant similarity to any other genes. A homology search of the ORFs also identified several new gene clusters. Those include two clusters of fimbrial genes, a gene cluster of three genes encoding homologues of the human long chain fatty acid degradation enzyme complex in the mitochondrial membrane, a cluster of at least nine genes involved in the utilization of ethanolamine, a cluster of the secondary set of 11 hyc genes participating in the formate hydrogenlyase reaction and a cluster of five genes coding for the homologues of degradation enzymes for aromatic hydrocarbons in Pseudomonas putida . We also noted a variety of novel genes, including two ORFs, which were homologous to the putative genes encoding xanthine dehydrogenase in the fly and a protein responsible for axonal guidance and outgrowth of the rat, mouse and nematode.

The terminal repeat array (T 2 AG 3 ) has lately been considered as an additional basis to analyze genomes of highly related species. The recent isolation of subtelomeric DNA probes specific for human (HSA) chromosomes 7q and 14q has prompted us to cross-hybridize them to the chromosomes of the chimpanzee (PTR), gorilla (GGO) and orangutan (PPY) to search for its equivalent locations in the great ape species. Both probes hybridized to the equivalent telomeric sites of the long (q) arms of all three great ape species. Hybridization signals to the 7q subtelomeric DNA sequence probe were observed at the telomeres of HSA 7q, PTR 6q, GGO 6q and PPY 10q, while hybridization signals to the 14q subtelomeric DNA sequence probe were observed at the telomeres of HSA 14q, PTR 15q, GGO 18q and PPY 15q. No hybridization signals to the chromosome 7-specific alpha satellite DNA probe on the centromeric regions of the ape chromosomes were observed. Our observations demonstrate sequence homology of the subtelomeric repeat families D7S427 and D14S308 in the ape chromosomes. An analogous number of subtelomeric repeat units exists in these chromosomes and has been preserved through the course of differentiation of the hominoid species. Our investigation also suggests a difference in the number of alpha satellite DNA repeat units in the equivalent ape chromosomes, possibly derived from interchromosomal transfers and subsequent amplification of ancestral alpha satellite sequences.

"," The nucleotide sequence of a 45,137-bp segment covering the 19° and 23° region in the 360° map of the Bacillus subtilis genome was determined. This region contained 45 open reading frames (ORFs) including 7 which corresponded to the products of genes with known functions that had been previously sequenced. The known genes were: glpT and glpQ for glycerol utilization pathway; purT for a part of the purine synthesis pathway; mpr for an extracellular metalloprotease; pss and psd for the parts of the phospholipid synthesis pathway; and gltP for a glutamine transporter. Deduced amino acid sequences of the 22 newly identified ORFs showed significant homologies to known gene products in the database such as a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) gene which is related to drug resistance, a two component response regulator, a series of amino acid permeases, transcriptional regulators, ß-lactamase, the phosphotransferase system (PTS) enzyme II for sugar uptake, and the eukaryotic ECA39 gene which is associated with cancer and apoptosis, etc. The remaining 16 ORFs did not show any significant sequence similarities to known gene products in the database.
